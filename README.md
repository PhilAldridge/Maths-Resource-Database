# Maths-Resource-Database
## Introduction
Website with a database for storing maths resources as well as creating a tree of prerequisite skills. This gives you not only the resources to teach a given subject but the knowledge of what students need to understand before working on this topic and where the potential difficulties in the topic might arise. This builds directly of Siegfried Engelmann's 'theory of instruction' and 'atomisation' in particular.
